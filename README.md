# TaskTool

A text based command line task and to-do tool in Java.

There are dozens of task/to-do tools that are much better than this, so why bother? I'm learning Java and this is an exercise. Reading tutorials and watching videos will only get you so far, and to really learn a programming language you need to actually create real apps.

TaskTool probably isn't perfect, and only uses what I have learnt so far. There may be better ways to do things, and future plans include a GUI version. That's a way off at the moment though.

If you are learning Java, I hope you find this useful. It's longer than the usual examples you get in courses, but not as complex as a pro project.

**Update**: [TaskToolCmd](https://github.com/rwaddilove/TaskToolCmd) is a version of this that runs from the command line. You interact with it like: 'TaskToolCmd sort label' to sort by label for example. There is always more than one way to do things and I rewrote a fair bit, partly to see if it was any better another way, or simply to learn more/better Java.
